        <p>To provide the best customer satisfaction, we provide the following solutions. Feel free to contact us if you
            have any questions regarding our Refund Policy by emailing us at <a class="link-change" href="">contact@nashandtender.com</a>.</p>

        <p><strong class="red">Food Order Errors*</strong><br>
            If you receive food that is different from your receipt, we sincerely apologize. Please return to the
            location you ordered from so we can correct your order. Your order will be priority if you come to pick it
            up. If you’re not able to return, we will provide store credit for a future visit. In all cases, <em>please
                return the food order in the original container(s)*</em>.
            </p>

        <p>
            Any food errors on orders from third-party delivery apps must be resolved through the app it was ordered
            from. Contact support from DoorDash, UberEats, or GrubHub.
        </p>

        <p>
            Refunds & Store Credit are only available for orders in which the food is wrong, omitted, and in other
            similar circumstances.
        </p>

        <p><strong class="red">Food Dissatisfaction*</strong><br>
            We cook our food fresh to order with only the finest and freshest ingredients. We take great care and pride
            in all of the dishes we make. Refunds are not provided for food that a guest simply does not like.
        </p>

        <p><strong class="red">Cancel Order*</strong><br>
            Sorry, we cannot cancel, refund, or give store credit if you change your mind or mistakenly order an item
            after the order is prepared. We cannot provide any refund or store credit for non-food items or beverages.
        </p>

        <p><strong class="red">Delivery Partners*</strong><br>
            If your order is modified or canceled by any third-party delivery apps, we are unable to provide any refund
            or store credit. Any issues with any delivery orders must be resolved through the app it was ordered from.
            Contact support from DoorDash, UberEats, or GrubHub.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a private business, it is the right of the restaurant to deny or refuse service to any customer for any
            reason. If a customer abuses our Refund Policies we, unfortunately, will not be able to conduct future
            business with the customer so that we may continue to provide excellent and quality food and service for you
            and our other wonderful and frequent patrons.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please note: we strive to prepare and package our pickup items to preserve the high quality of the food. Keep
            in mind the temperature, sauce, and consistency of some items may vary slightly after being packaged.
        </p>

        <p>
            If 25% or more of the food has been consumed or removed, we cannot issue any discount, refund, or store
            credit. If the food has been discarded, repackaged, or tampered with, then we cannot verify its origin or
            issue and cannot issue any discount, refund, or store credit. Also, we will only prepare a second food order
            in all situations and we will not prepare a third order replacement.
        </p>
        <p><strong class="red">SAUCES</strong>
            <br>
            As of August 2022, customers are given one Special Sauce for every menu item & combo and 2 Special Sauces
            for any 3 Piece, Kiddo Combo, or Combo 5. Ranch and BBQ will no longer be allowed to be substituted or
            traded for more Special Sauce.
